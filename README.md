# Retro Sokoban Clone

The Retro Sokoban Clone project is a Sokoban-type logic game, created in C++ using the SFML library. The game allows for the manipulation of boxes within a limited space with the objective of placing them in designated locations.

## Introduction

The Sokoban game is a classic logic game in which the player must move boxes to marked places on the map. Retro Sokoban Clone takes this concept into a graphical environment using C++ and SFML, offering a user interface and graphics that comply with modern standards.

## Technologies

The project was implemented using the following technologies:
- C++ (ISO C++17 standard `/std:c++17`)
- SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)
- NuGet for easy management of SFML dependencies

## Installation

To install and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your device:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LeoTheOriginal/Retro-Sokoban-Clone.git
2. Open the project in an environment that supports C++17, e.g., Microsoft Visual Studio.
3. Ensure you have the correct version of SFML installed. You can use NuGet to install SFML by right-clicking on the project in Visual Studio, selecting `Manage NuGet Packages`, and searching for `SFML`.

## Usage
Run the program from your IDE or command line. The game is controlled using arrow keys. You can also undo moves using the `Ctrl+Z` key combination.

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute to the development of the project, you can `fork` the repository and then send `pull requests` with new features, fixes, or documentation.
